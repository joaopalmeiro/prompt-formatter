Question: What should I do to fix my disconnected wifi? The light on my Google Wifi router is yellow and blinking slowly.

Text:
Color: Slowly pulsing yellow
What it means: There is a network error.
What to do:
Check that the Ethernet cable is connected to both your router and your modem and both devices are turned on. You might need to unplug and plug in each device again.

Color: Fast blinking yellow
What it means: You are holding down the reset button and are factory resetting this device.
What to do:
If you keep holding down the reset button, after about 12 seconds, the light will turn solid yellow. Once it is solid yellow, let go of the factory reset button.

Color: Solid yellow
What it means: Router is factory resetting.
What to do:
This can take up to 10 minutes. When it's done, the device will reset itself and start pulsing white, letting you know it's ready for setup.

Color: Solid red
What it means: Something is wrong.
What to do:
Critical failure. Factory reset the router. If the light stays red, contact Wifi customer support.</code></pre>
